## Section 3 - *Hazards Identification*
### EMERGENCY OVERVIEW
- Appearance: clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid.
- **Danger!** Causes eye and skin burns. Causes digestive and respiratory tract burns. May be fatal if inhaled or swallowed. Repeated or prolonged exposure may cause erosion of exposed teeth. Corrosive to metal.  
- **Target Organs:** Respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, teeth, eyes, skin.
#### **Potential Health Effects**
- **Eye:** May cause irreversible eye injury. Vapor or mist may cause irritation and severe burns. Contact with liquid is corrosive to the eyes and causes severe burns.  
- **Skin:** Contact with liquid is corrosive and causes severe burns and ulceration. The severity of injury depends on the concentration of the solution and the duration of exposure.  
- **Ingestion:** Causes severe digestive tract burns with abdominal pain, vomiting, and possible death. May cause corrosion and permanent tissue destruction of the esophagus and digestive tract.  
- **Inhalation:** May be fatal if inhaled. May cause severe irritation of the respiratory tract with sore throat, coughing, shortness of breath and delayed lung edema. Causes chemical burns to the respiratory tract. Causes corrosive action on the mucous membranes.  
- **Chronic:** Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause dermatitis. Repeated exposure may cause erosion of teeth. Repeated exposure to low concentrations of HCl vapor or mist may cause bleeding of nose and gums. Chronic bronchitis and gastritis have also been reported.

## Section 4 - *First Aid Measures*
- **Eyes:** In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for a t least 15 minutes. Get medical aid immediately.  
- **Skin:** In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical aid immediately. Wash clothing before reuse.  
- **Ingestion:** If swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting. Get medical aid immediately. If victim is fully conscious, give a cupful of water. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.  
- **Inhalation:** POISON material. If inhaled, get medical aid immediately. Remove victim to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen.  
- **Notes to Physician:** Do NOT use sodium bicarbonate in an attempt to neutralize the acid.

## Section 5 - *Fire Fighting Measures*

- **General Information:** As in any fire, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus in pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent), and full protective gear. Water runoff can cause environmental damage. Dike and collect water used to fight fire. Not flammable, but reacts with most metals to form flammable hydrogen gas. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool. Vapors may be heavier than air. They can spread along the ground and collect in low or confined areas. Containers may explode when heated.  
- **Extinguishing Media:** Substance is noncombustible; use agent most appropriate to extinguish surrounding fire.  
- **Flash Point:** Not applicable.  
- **Autoignition Temperature:** Not applicable.  
- **Explosion Limits, Lower:**Not available.  
- **Upper:** Not available.  
- **NFPA Rating:** (estimated) Health: 3; Flammability: 0; Instability: 1
